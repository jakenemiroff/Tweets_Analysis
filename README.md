# Tweets Analysis

This is a small school project written in python using a small subset of real tweets.

Tweets were split up into different regions by longitude and latitude, 
and a simple sentiment analysis was run on each region to determine an overall happiness score.

Simple graphics were used to build a histogram of the scores generated.
